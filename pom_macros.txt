=== Macros for POM modification

Sometimes Maven `pom.xml` files need to be patched before they are used
to build packages. One could use traditional patches to maintain
changes, but package maintainers should use `%pom_*` macros developed
specially to ease this task.
Using `%pom_*` macros not only increases readability of the spec file,
but also improves maintainability of the package as there are no patches
that would need to be rebased with each upstream release.

There are two categories of macros:

- POM-specific macros - used to manipulate dependencies, modules... Some
  of them also work on `ivy.xml` files.
- Generic XML manipulation macros - used to add/remove/replace XML nodes

The macros are designed to be called from `%prep` section of spec
files. All the macros also have their own manual page.
This document provides an overview of how they are used. For the
technical details, refer to their respective manpages.

.File specfication
By default, a macro acts on a `pom.xml` file (or `ivy.xml` file) in the
current directory. Different path can be explicitly specified via an
argument (the last one, unless stated otherwise). Multiple paths can be
specified as multiple arguments. If a path is a directory, it looks for
a `pom.xml` file in that directory.
For example:
[source,spec]
----
# The following works on pom.xml file in the current directory
%pom_remove_parent

# The following works on submodule/pom.xml
%pom_remove_parent submodule

# The following works on submodule/pom.xml as well
%pom_remove_parent submodule/pom.xml

# The following works on submodule2/pom.xml and submodule2/pom.xml
%pom_remove_parent submodule1 submodule2
----

.Recursive mode
Most macros also support *recursive* mode, where the change is applied
to the `pom.xml` and all its modules recursively. This can be used, for
example, to remove a dependency from the whole project. It is activated
by `-r` switch.


[[pom_remove_dep]]
==== Dependency manipulation macros
.Removing dependencies
Often dependencies specified in Maven `pom.xml` files need to be removed
because of different reasons. `%pom_remove_dep` macro can be used to
ease this task:

[source,spec]
--------
# Removes dependency with groupId "foo" and artifactId "bar" from pom.xml
%pom_remove_dep foo:bar

# Removes dependency on all artifacts with groupId "foo" from pom.xml
%pom_remove_dep foo:

# Removes dependency on all artifacts with artifactId "bar" from pom.xml
%pom_remove_dep :bar

# Removes dependency on all artifacts with artifactId "bar" from submodule1/pom.xml
%pom_remove_dep :bar submodule1

# Removes dependency on all artifacts with artifactId "bar" from pom.xml
# and all its submodules
%pom_remove_dep -r :bar

# Removes all dependencies from pom.xml
%pom_remove_dep :
--------

.Adding dependencies
Dependencies can also be added to `pom.xml` with `%pom_add_dep` macro.
Usage is very similar to `%pom_remove_dep`, see `"man pom_add_dep"` for
more information.

.Changing dependencies
Sometimes the artifact coordinates used in upstream `pom.xml` don't
correspond to ones used in Fedora and you need to modify them.
`%pom_change_dep` macro will modify all dependencies matching the first
argument to artifact coordinates specified by the second argument. Note
this macro also works in recursive mode.

[source,spec]
-----
# For all artifacts in pom.xml that have groupId 'example' change it to
# 'com.example' while leaving artifactId and other parts intact
%pom_change_dep example: com.example:
-----

[[pom_remove_plugin]]
==== Adding/removing plugins

`%pom_remove_plugin` macro works exactly as `%pom_remove_dep`, except it removes
Maven plugin invocations. Some examples:

.Removing Maven plugins from pom.xml files
[source,spec]
--------
# Disables maven-jar-plugin so that classpath isn't included in manifests
%pom_remove_plugin :maven-jar-plugin

# Disable a proprietary plugin that isn't packaged for Fedora
%pom_remove_plugin com.example.mammon:useless-proprietary-plugin submodule
--------

Like in previous case, there is also a macro for adding plugins to
`pom.xml`. See `"man pom_add_plugin"` for more information.

[[pom_disable_module]]
==== Disabling unneeded modules

Sometimes some submodules of upstream project cannot be built for
various reasons and there is a need to disable them. This can be
achieved by using `%pom_disable_module`, for example:

.Disabling specific project modules
[source,spec]
--------
# Disables child-module-1, a submodule of the main pom.xml file
%pom_disable_module child-module-1

# Disables grandchild-module, a submodule of child-module-2/pom.xml
%pom_disable_module grandchild-module child-module-2
--------

[[pom_remove_parent]]
==== Working with parent POM references

Macro `%pom_remove_parent` removes reference to a parent POM from Maven
POM files. This can be useful when parent POM is not yet packaged (e.g.
because of licensing issues) and at the same time it's not really needed
for building of the project. There are also macros for adding parent POM
reference (`%pom_add_parent`) and replacing existing reference with new
one (`%pom_set_parent`).

.Manipulating parent POM references
[source,spec]
--------
# Remove reference to a parent POM from ./pom.xml
%pom_remove_parent

# Remove reference to a parent POM from ./submodule/pom.xml
%pom_remove_parent submodule

# Add parent POM reference to ./pom.xml
%pom_add_parent groupId:artifactId

# Replace existing parent POM reference in ./pom.xml
%pom_set_parent groupId:artifactId:version
--------

[[pom_xpath_remove]]
==== Macros for performing generic modifications

The above macros cover the most common cases of modifying `pom.xml`
files, however if there is a need to apply some less-common patches
there are also three generic macros for modifying `pom.xml` files.
These generic macros can also be applied to other XML files, such as
Ant's `build.xml` files.

They all take a link:http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/[XPath] 1.0 expression
that selects XML nodes to be acted on (removed, replaced...).

.Handling XML namespaces
[NOTE]
=======
POM files use a specific namespace - \http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0.
The easiest way to respect this namespace in XPath expressions is
prefixing all node names with `pom:`. For example,
`pom:environment/pom:os` will work because it selects nodes from `pom`
namespace, but `environment/os` won't find anything because it looks for
nodes that don't belong to any XML namespace. It is needed even if the
original POM file didn't contain proper POM namespace, since it will be
added automatically. Note that this requirement is due to limitation of
XPath 1.0 and we cannot work it around.
=======

.Removing nodes
`%pom_xpath_remove` can be used to remove arbitrary XML nodes.
[source,spec]
--------
# Removes extensions from the build
%pom_xpath_remove "pom:build/pom:extensions" module/pom.xml
--------

.Injecting nodes
`%pom_xpath_inject` macro is capable of injecting arbitrary
XML code to any `pom.xml` file. The injected code is the last argument
- optional file paths go before it (unlike most other macros).
To pass a multiline snippet, quote the argument as in the following
example.
[source,spec]
--------
# Add additional exclusion into maven-wagon dependency
%pom_xpath_inject "pom:dependency[pom:artifactId='maven-wagon']/pom:exclusions" "
<exclusion>
    <groupId>antlr</groupId>
    <artifactId>antlr</artifactId>
</exclusion>"
# The same thing, but with explicit file path
%pom_xpath_inject "pom:dependency[pom:artifactId='maven-wagon']/pom:exclusions" pom.xml "
<exclusion>
    <groupId>antlr</groupId>
    <artifactId>antlr</artifactId>
</exclusion>"
--------

.Changing nodes' content
`%pom_xpath_set` replaces content of the arbitrary XML nodes
with specified value (can contain XML nodes).
[source,spec]
--------
# Change groupId of a parent
%pom_xpath_set "pom:parent/pom:groupId" "org.apache"
--------

.Replacing nodes
`%pom_xpath_replace` replaces a XML node with specified XML code.
[source,spec]
--------
# Change groupId of a parent (note the difference from %pom_xpath_set)
%pom_xpath_replace "pom:parent/pom:groupId" "<groupId>org.apache</groupId>"
--------
