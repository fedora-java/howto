==== Relative paths

JAR artifacts are installed in one of standard
directory trees.  Usually this is either `%{_javadir}`
(`/usr/share/java`) or `%{_jnidir}` (`/usr/lib/java`).

The simplest way of identifying artifacts is using their relative path
from one of standard locations.  All artifact can be identified this
way because each artifacts has a unique file name.  Each path
identifying artifact will be called _artifact path_ in this document.

To keep artifact paths simpler and more readable, extension can be
omitted if it is equal to `jar`.  For non-JAR artifacts extension
cannot be omitted and must be retained.

Additionally, if artifact path points to a directory then it
represents all artifacts contained in this directory.  This allows a
whole set of related artifacts to be referenced easily by specifying
directory name containing all of them.

If the same artifact path has valid expansions in two different root
directories then it is unspecified which artifacts will be located.
