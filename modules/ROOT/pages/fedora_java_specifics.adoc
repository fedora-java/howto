== Java Specifics in Fedora for Users and Developers
This section contains information about default Java implementation in Fedora, switching between different Java runtime environments and about few useful tools which can be used during packaging / development.

=== Java implementation in Fedora
Fedora ships with an open-source reference implementation of Java Standard Edition called https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK].
OpenJDK provides Java Runtime Environment for Java applications and set of development tools for Java developers.

From users point of view, `java` command is probably the most interesting.
It is a Java application launcher which spawns Java Virtual Machine (JVM), loads specified `.class` file and executes its main method.

Here is an example how to run sample Java project from section <<_example_java_project>>:

[source,shell]
----
$ java org/fedoraproject/helloworld/HelloWorld.class
----

OpenJDK provides a lot of interesting tools for Java developers:

- `javac` is a Java compiler which translates source files to Java bytecode, which can be later interpreted by JVM.
- `jdb` is a simple command-line debugger for Java applications.
- `javadoc` is a tool for generating Javadoc documentation.
- `javap` can be used for disassembling Java class files.

==== Switching between different Java implementations
Users and developers may want to have multiple Java environments installed at the same time.
It is possible in Fedora, but only one of them can be default Java environment in system.
Fedora uses `alternatives` for switching between different installed JREs/JDKs.

----
# alternatives --config java

There are 3 programs which provide 'java'.

  Selection    Command
  -----------------------------------------------
   1           java-17-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-17.0.2.0.8-1.fc35.x86_64/bin/java)
*+ 2           java-11-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.14.1.1-5.fc35.x86_64/bin/java)
   3           java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-18-openjdk-18.0.1.0.10-1.rolling.fc35.x86_64/bin/java)

Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number:
----

Example above shows how to chose default Java environment. `java` command will then point to the Java implementation provided by given JRE.

[TIP]
====
See `man alternatives` for more information on how to use `alternatives`.
====

Developers may want to use Java compiler from different JDK.
This can be achieved with `alternatives --config javac`.

=== Building classpath with `build-classpath`
Most of the Java application needs to specify classpath in order to work correctly.
Fedora contains several tools which make working with classpaths easier.

`build-classpath` - this tool takes JAR filenames or artifact coordinates as arguments and translates them to classpath-like string.
See the following example:

[source,shell]
----
$ build-classpath log4j junit org.ow2.asm:asm
/usr/share/java/log4j.jar:/usr/share/java/junit.jar:/usr/share/java/objectweb-asm4/asm.jar
----

`log4j` corresponds to `log4j.jar` stored in +`%{_javadir}`+.
If the JAR file is stored in subdirectory under +`%{_javadir}`+, it is neccessary to pass `subdirectory/jarname` as an argument to `build-classpath`.
Example:

[source,shell]
----
$ build-classpath httpcomponents/httpclient.jar
/usr/share/java/httpcomponents/httpclient.jar
----

=== Building JAR repository with `build-jar-repository`

Another tool is `build-jar-repository`.
It can fill specified directory with symbolic / hard links to specified JAR files.
Similarly to `build-classpath`, JARs can be identified by their names or artifact coordintes.

[source,shell]
----
$ build-jar-repository my-repo log4j httpcomponents/httpclient junit:junit
$ ls -l my-repo/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 msrb msrb 45 Oct 29 10:39 [httpcomponents][httpclient].jar -> /usr/share/java/httpcomponents/httpclient.jar
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 msrb msrb 25 Oct 29 10:39 [junit:junit].jar -> /usr/share/java/junit.jar
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 msrb msrb 25 Oct 29 10:39 [log4j].jar -> /usr/share/java/log4j.jar
----

Similar command `rebuild-jar-repository` can be used to rebuild JAR repository previously built by `build-jar-repository`.
See `man rebuild-jar-repository` for more information.

`build-classpath-directory` is a small tool which can be used to build classpath string from specified directory.

[source,shell]
----
$ build-classpath-directory /usr/share/java/xstream
/usr/share/java/xstream/xstream-benchmark.jar:/usr/share/java/xstream/xstream.jar
:/usr/share/java/xstream/xstream-hibernate.jar
