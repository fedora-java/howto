Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on
the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven is by far the most consistent Java build system, allowing large amount of
automation. In most common situations only following steps are necessary:

1. In `%build` section of the spec file use `%mvn_build` macro
2. In `%install` section, use `%mvn_install` macro
3. Use generated file `.mfiles` lists to populate `%files` section with `-f` switch

.Common spec file sections
[source,spec]
--------
BuildRequires:  maven-local
...
%build
%mvn_build
...

%install
%mvn_install
...


%files -f .mfiles
%dir %{_javadir}/%{name}

%files javadoc -f .mfiles-javadoc
--------


The macros `%mvn_build` and `%mvn_install` automatically handle building of the
JAR files and their subsequent installation to the correct directory. The
corresponding POM and metadata files are also installed.
