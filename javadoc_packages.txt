=== Javadoc packages

Javadoc subpackages in Fedora provide automatically generated API
documentation for Java libraries and applications.
REFERENCE(fedora_java_specifics, openjdk, Java Development Kit) comes with tool
called `javadoc`. This tool can be used for generating the documentation from
specially formated comments in Java source files.  Output of this tool, together
with license files, usually represents only content of javadoc subpackages.
Note `javadoc` invocation is typically handled by build system and package
maintainer doesn't need to deal with it directly.

Javadoc subpackage shouldn't depend on its base package and vice versa.
The rationale behind this rule is that documentation can usually be used
independently from application/library and therefore base package
doesn't need to be always installed. Users are given an option to
install application and documentation separately.
